Community-driven decision-making: As a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), FLIP House SNS puts the power in the hands of the community. Every member has a voice in shaping our direction, from deciding on new game launches to proposing governance protocols.


Flip House is preparing to launch its SNS DAO for FLIP DAO with a proposal to start the decentralization sale soon. This post is a forum for the IC Community to discuss about FLIP house SNS.

For the past two years, FLIP House has been dedicated to pioneering fully decentralized P2E games on the Internet Computer. Our flagship creation, IC FLIP has garnered attention and accolades for its innovative approach to gaming. Now, weâ€™re expanding our vision with the introduction of IC House - a collaborative platform where creators can launch their own P2E games alongside our in-house offerings.

The FLIP House SNS DAO serves as the social backbone of IC House, fostering community engagement, collaboration, and growth within the ecosystem. By harnessing the power of decentralized governance, we empower our community members to shape the future of P2E gaming on the Internet Computer.
